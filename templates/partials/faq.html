                <summary>Why are AI-generated websites slow?</summary>
                <p>AI website builders like Bolt.new, Lovable, and Base44 generate bloated React applications with massive JavaScript bundles (2-5MB), unoptimized images, and server-side rendering overhead. This results in load times of 12-20 seconds, far above Google's recommended 2.5-second threshold.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>How much faster will my site be after migration?</summary>
                <p>On average, migrated sites load 7x faster. A typical Bolt.new site loading in 20 seconds will load in under 3 seconds after migration to optimized static hosting on a global CDN.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Does website speed affect SEO and Google rankings?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Google confirmed Core Web Vitals (including LCP - Largest Contentful Paint) are ranking factors. Sites with LCP over 4 seconds receive ranking penalties, while sites under 2.5 seconds get a ranking boost. Slow sites also have higher bounce rates and lower conversions.</p>
